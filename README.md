# Cooperators_2024

README!

In Order:
- ``solution_knn.ipynb``: Fit a solution similar to classwork using KNN regressor architecture
- ``solution_missing.ipynb``: Use info from MCAR to test if missing values are randomly missing or have bias. Found that bias exists.
- ``solution_fill_vals.ipynb``: File starts with filling missing values in ways that are helpful (see Imputer). Then, executes new ML algorithms.

If you plan to make edits please create a new file!
